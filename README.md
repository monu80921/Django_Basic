# Django Basic

In this project, I had the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of Django, a popular Python web framework. Firstly, I learned how to perform user authentication and authorization, which is core functionality in many web applications. Additionally, I was able to connect to two different databases - basic SQLite and PostgreSQL. This was great because it allowed me to compare and contrast the two databases and understand their strengths and weaknesses.

Furthermore, I learned about dynamic URL routing, which allows for a more flexible and scalable web application. I understood the differences between the POST and GET methods, and how to use them in different scenarios. Additionally, I was introduced to the Django-admin panel, which provides an easy-to-use interface for managing the various components of a Django project. 

In this project, I mainly focused on the backend part. I took an HTML template from BootstrapMade and connected it with Django to create a dynamic web application. Throughout the project, I learned how to perform user authentication and authorization, connect to different databases, use dynamic URL routing, and integrate HTML forms with Django. I'm excited about the possibilities of Django and look forward to exploring more advanced concepts in the future.

Finally, I was able to integrate HTML forms with Django. This was a key learning for me because it allowed me to better understand how data flows between a web page and a server. Overall, I am excited about the possibilities of Django and look forward to exploring more advanced concepts in the future.
