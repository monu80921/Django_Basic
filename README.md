# Django Basic

In this project, I had the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of Django, a popular Python web framework. Firstly, I learnt how to perform user authentication and authorization, which is a core functionality in many web applications. Additionally, I was able to connect to two different databases - basic SQLite and PostgreSQL. This was great because it allowed me to compare and contrast the two databases and understand their strengths and weaknesses.

Furthermore, I learnt about dynamic URL routing, which allows for a more flexible and scalable web application. I understood the differences between the POST and GET methods, and how to use them in different scenarios. Additionally, I was introduced to the Django-admin panel, which provides an easy-to-use interface for managing the various components of a Django project.

Finally, I was able to integrate HTML forms with Django. This was a key learning for me because it allowed me to better understand how data flows between a web page and a server. Overall, I am really excited about the possibilities of Django and look forward to exploring more advanced concepts in the future.
